Learning is a *motivated* process which involves updating/evolving structures to incoroprate something new. This can include integrating new, strengthening existing connections, reconsidering or rerouting existing connections. Learning is an active, agentic process—*not* merely a process of obtaining.

Someone (or something) with a mind that updates itself in response to input is a "learner". A "good learner" is someone who steers parts of this process both when integrating new external knowledge and creating new knowledge from within. (Stems from the idea that learning is happening at both Amber Hill and Phoenix Park, even though it is a different mechanism and different things being learned.)

Some ways to promote learning…
From Brown & Campione:
- Modified jigsaw involving interest-based expert groups.

From Boaler:
- no tracking (in Pheonix Park)
- Seeing math as a community of practice

From Yamaguchi:
- The teacher talks less than the students
- Engaging community

Strategies that have worked well for me:
- Having an environment structured to support me in acting in accordance with my will and learning goals.

For a classmate:
- Teachers having high expectations because it's inspiring to know what's possible ("I must be able to do this if my teacher thinks I can")

And for both:
- Feeling agency and the *rationale* for learning something—a sense of not just "why is this important to learn" (in the abstract) but "why is this important for *me* to learn." Otherwise requests for students' time and attention are easily (and not incorrectly) reduced to "how can I get this done [if it is being "required" of me] with minimal wasted effort?"
- Students talking more than teachers

"Pedagogy" is how to teach or how to facilitate learning.

"Good pedagogy" often consists of the following principles, even when it varies greatly:

- Involved: Active construction of knowledge. (Brown & Campione: students are "active constructors of knowledge"; Yamaguchi: "joint *productive* activity")
- Introspective: Students are using metacognition to recognize, and later improve upon, *how* they are learning
- "Smart": This is coming from Joe Alberti's frequent admonition to his students that they "work smarter, not harder", and Alfie Kohn's idea that "harder does not mean better". "Smart" pedagogy instead acknowledges that we have cognitive predispositions which make certain ways of learning easier than others (e.g. the number of distinct pieces of new information you can hold in your short term memory at once limits certain things, and our minds take all sorts of shortcuts, as per Ramachandran's Bag of Tricks), and takes advantage of these, working *with* the mind rather than *against* it.
- Social and communal: Learning often happens through communication, since communication forces ideas to become at least as structured as they need to be to attempt to communicate them. It also allows for misconceptions to be exposed and corrected, and for different perspectives or ways of looking at the same idea to strengthen a whole group's understanding of that idea. Learners can support each other. (Brown & Campione: "learning is social & situated in community"; Yamaguchi: "*joint* productive activity")
- Contextual: Learning is connected to the learners' lives and community. This does not just mean that "community issues" are sometimes discussed in the classroom—*everything* can actually be made relevant to the community. This is also not just about *content*, or *what* is learned—this is also about the *ways* of learning & interacting, or *how* it is learned. (Yamaguchi: contextualization [3rd principle])
- Stretching: Facilitating learning requires working in learners' zones of proximal development: what they haven't yet learned that is conceptually close enough to what they *have* learned to be able to learn it without undue difficulty. Working in this zone may look like posing challenging activities, that stretch what students think their abilities are. (Yamaguchi: challenging activities [4th principle])
